# natural-service

<p>This is a proof-of-concept for creating SoftwareAG Natural micro-services.</p>
<p>Current plan is to use Python and Flask to invoke Natural and run a program when a GET request is made. The  output of the program is a work file. The work file is read once the program has completed executing and the contents are returned in the HTTP response.</p>
